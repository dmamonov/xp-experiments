XP Language experiment
========================================================================
This is the XP language - a programming language inspired and still close
to PHP but with the oddities removed, sugar added and a compiler wrapped
around it.

Overview
--------
Here's a list of the subdirectories inside this one and what you will 
find inside:
<pre>
  - tests   : Unittests
  - cmd     : Utility xpclis
  - demo    : Examples
  - grammar : Grammars
  - xp      : Implementation
</code>

Prerequisites
-------------
You will need the Opcode Engineering Library extension (short: <tt>oel</tt>)
compiled into PHP. You will find the sourcecode inside the Ruben's experiment
directory (../../people/wagner/oel-extension).

Building (shown for Windows, almost the same as on Un*x though):
<pre>
  $ cd ~/devel/php/php_5_2
  $ cp -r ~/devel/xp.forge/trunk/experiments/people/wagner/oel-extension/oel_ct/src/oel ext
  $ cscript /nologo configure.js --enable-oel
  $ nmake
</pre>

After the build has succeeded, change the XP runtime by adding the 
following section to your <tt>xp.ini</tt>:
<pre>
  [runtime]
  oel=F:/cygwin/home/Timm Friebe/devel/php/php_5_2/Release_TS/php.exe
</pre>

Hacking
-------
When changing the grammar file you need to regenerate the parser:
<pre>
  $ make grammar
</pre>
