Strict overlay for XP Framework
================================

About
------

This is an overlay for the XP Framework that implement more
strict error checking rules than standard XP Framework. This
implementation adds checks for:

* Read / write on undeclared class property
* Execution of undeclared class method
* Certain PHP notices that often arise from typos or
  refactorings that can cause quite a big headache when
  trying to trace a bug

Installation
-------------

Before anything works, you'll need the patch from RFC #0201. Then
just append the path

  ~/devel/xp.forge/trunk/experiments/arena/strict/

to the use= setting in you xp.ini (usually located where your
runners are).
