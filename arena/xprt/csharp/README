XP Runners with C#
========================================================================
$Id$

<summary>
This experiment is the predecessor to the XP runners. This page is kept
for historic reasons, but the runners have since been extended and moved
to the installation infrastructure repository. They can be installed by
the framework setup procedure.

DO NOT USE THESE RUNNERS HERE!

Howto: Build
------------
Run "make" to build the XP runners. If you don't have "csc" (the C Sharp
Compiler) in your path, you may tell make where to find it as follows:

<pre>
  CSC=/cygdrive/c/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v3.5/csc.exe make
</pre>

This step will produce the following binaries:
<pre>
  xp.exe xpcli.exe xar.exe unittest.exe cgen.exe doclet.exe
</pre>

Howto: Install
--------------
After building the binaries, copy them to a location in your $PATH and 
create a file called "xp.ini" in the same directory. Inside that, define
the location where you have your XP framework installation.

Example xp.ini in ~/bin:
<pre>
  use=../devel/xp/trunk
</pre>
