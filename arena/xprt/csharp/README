XP Runners with C#
========================================================================
$Id$

Howto: Build
------------
Run "make" to build the XP runners. If you don't have "csc" (the C Sharp
Compiler) in your path, you may tell make where to find it as follows:

<pre>
  CSC=/cygdrive/c/Windows/Microsoft.NET/Framework/v3.5/csc.exe make
</pre>

This step will produce the following binaries:
<pre>
  xp.exe xpcli.exe xar.exe unittest.exe cgen.exe doclet.exe
</pre>

Howto: Install
--------------
After building the binaries, copy them to a location in your $PATH and 
create a file called "xp.ini" in the same directory. Inside that, define
the location where you have your XP framework installation.

Example xp.ini in ~/bin:
<pre>
  use=../devel/xp/trunk
</pre>

<EOF>
