BCompiler Bugs
========================================================================
$Id$

The following bugs were found during unittesting a bcompile'd version of 
the XP framework:

Missing __toString()
--------------------
Found via: net.xp_framework.unittest.core.types.BytesTest and
net.xp_framework.unittest.core.types.StringTest

"Object of class Bytes could not be converted to string"

Fix exists in patch @ http://news.php.net/php.pecl.dev/5439


Array type hints
----------------
Found via unittests/rdbms.ini

"Fatal error: Declaration of MockDialect::makeJoinBy() must be compatible 
with that of SQLDialect::makeJoinBy()"

Declaration in rdbms.SQLDialect:
<code>
  public abstract function makeJoinBy(array $conditions)
</code>

Array type hinting appeared first in PHP 5.1.

Overly long keys
----------------
When the filename of the compiled file is too long hash keys are 
generated that are too long to be serialized as a char. This leads to 
side effects of instruction being overwritten by overflowing data:

"Fatal error: Argument 1 passed to ClassLoader::registerLoader() 
must implement interface IClassLoader" and "Fatal error: Exceptions 
must be valid objects derived from the Exception base class".

Can be worked around by using a short path name when compiling, e.g.
/tmp/LocalClassName.class.php instead of 
~/xp.forge/trunk/experiments/people/friebe/opcodes/LocalClassName.class.php.

Fix exists in patch @ http://news.php.net/php.pecl.dev/5439


No 5.3 support
--------------
Namespaces are not supported yet. Probably also some other features
won't work, and definitely the changes in _zval_struct have an
impact (see http://news.php.net/php.pecl.dev/5438).

BCompiler needs to be extended!
