XP Coding Standards for Sonar:
========================================================================
$Id$

How does it work
----------------
For sonar versions < 2.2 there is a php-sonar plugin which is utilizing pDepend,
CodeSniffer and some more php tools to generate static code analysis statistics
for php projects.

http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/PHP+Plugin

What does not work
------------------
The sonar phpunit plugin does not work as xp projects are not using phpunit for
unit testing. In order to make sonar work with xp projects you must not deploy
the phpunit sonar plugin!

PHP CodeSniffer Rules
---------------------
The Sonar Plugin is using a special CodeSniffer version from SQLI for checking
the coding standards. The provided set of rules is not compatible with the xp
coding guidelines. In order to add them you have to do some manual adjustments
though. 

The needed CodeSniffer and SQLI_CodeSniffer versions can be found here:

Install them with pear


XP Coding Standards Pear Package
--------------------------------
In the folder ./XP_CodeSniffer is a pear package that installs the xp coding
guideline rules. This package has to be installed on top of SQLI_CodeSniffer.
Due to the fact, that SQLI_CodeSniffer is using events instead of errors and
warnings the Sniffs have to be adjusted to create an event with a proper code
with addEvent() instead of addWarning() or addError(). 

In the Reports/config.xml file you have then to create an entry for the event 
code of the Sniff class. 

To build the pear package just type in: 

pear package package.xml



PHP Codesniffer Sonar Plugin
----------------------------
In order to make sonar understand the xp event codes you also have to add an
entry for every code into the

"java-plugin/src/main/resources/org/sonar/plugins/php/codesniffer/rules.xml"

file. There is already one entry to demonstrate how it should look. In order to
distinguish the XP rules from the normal CodeSniffer rules please make sure to
prefix them with "XP:". 

To build the sonar plugin type in: 

mvn package
<EOF>
