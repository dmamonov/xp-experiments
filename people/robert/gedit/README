I'm trying to pimp gedit that it looks and feels like actual nedit.
Please note that this is still in development and have a look into the ChangLog too.

You also need to install the mods from Ruben Wagner to get the full xp-functionality.
Just have a look into experiments/people/wagner/xp.ide

If you have any suggestions or improvements to share, just send me an email to:
robert_ledermueller@gmx.de

Thanks.

INSTALL
~~~~~~~
1. Install all mods from Ruben Wagner.

2. Install the package 'gedit-plugins' which is a common package in ubuntu. Here
   you will find some usefull and needed plugins!

3. Create gtksourcview-2.0 folder in your home directory
mkdir -p /home/username/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs
mkdir -p /home/username/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles

4. copy this php.lang
cp syntax/php.lang /home/username/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/php.lang

5. copy new style
cp style/xp_nedit.xml /home/username/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/styles/xp_nedit.xml

6. Change color of the variables. I prefer to use bold, red variables. But you can
   just change the following line to a color of your liking.
<style name="def:identifier"              foreground="dark-red" bold="true"/>

7. Gedit doesn't come with a built in regex search and replace function like nedit.
   Here you have to use one of the multiple third party plugins.
   Maybe the plugin 'Regex Search & Replace' may help. You can find it with several
   other plugins here: http://live.gnome.org/Gedit/Plugins

8. Useful options/configuration (warning: personal touch)

   Edit - Preferences - View
   - Disable text wrapping
   - Display line numbers
   - Highlight current line
   - Display right margin
   - Highlight matching bracket
   
   Edit - Preferences - Editor
   - Tab width 2
   - Insert spaces instead of tabs
   - Enable automatic indentation
   - disable File Saving

   Edit - Preferences - Font & Colors
   - font: Monospace 8-9 (this font is very similar to nedit)
   - Color Scheme: XP-NEdit-Style
   
   Edit - Preferences - Plugins (just the most important in my opinion) 
   - Indent Lines
   - Regex Search and Replace
   - Snippets
   - XP IDE

9. If you want to use the snippet plugin you can import my first snippet.
   snippets/Snippets archive.tar.gz
   If you have problems with importing this snippets make sure the following dir exists:
   /home/usrname/.gnome2/gedit/snippets
