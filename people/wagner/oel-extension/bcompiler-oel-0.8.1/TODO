TODO list.


Bcompiler source
----------------

- Function compiling
- Raw Opcode compiling

- Create Alternatives for 
	include_once
	require_once
	include
	require
  This will enable tests to see if files have already been included. or if a
  compiled version of these files exist... (either in the compiler stage - PHP),
  or in the bcompiler source)
 
- Add conditional method/var lists for class compilation.

PHP Compiler code
------------------
- finish off compiler PHP code 
	- complete handling of 'include and class stuff'
